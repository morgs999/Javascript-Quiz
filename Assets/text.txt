AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers


HTML
header (JavaScript quiz)
body
start button
setup of question and answers
timer
answer message
game over box
high score box

CSS
header (h1)
button
questions (h3)
answers (h4)
answer buttons
timer
answer message (h2)
game over box (h3)
high score box (p)



WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
// addevent listener for button, 
set interval for button, 
and generate from array a random question()

WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
// checkcorrect() function to match to correct answer; 
buttons for answers
?? randomly generate answer order??


WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
// incorrect(), reset interval (-10), rerun question()


WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
if timer == 0 || array is empty, gameover()

WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
if gameover(), savescore(), start button still available



//BCS Help to get the button click to return a correct answer
let answerChoice = document.querySelector(".answers");

let choice = answerChoice.addEventListener("click", function (event) {
    console.log("CLICK");
    return document.getElementById(button);
  });

// To check what click is doing
let choice = button.addEventListener("click", function () {
    console.log("CLICK");
    return document.getElementById(button);
  });
