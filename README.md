# Javascript Interactive Quiz

## Description
An interactive Javascript quiz that randomly generates a question and answer block for users to test their knowledge on some easy Javascript concepts.  An integrated timer and high score let users keep track of how well they're doing and race the clock to get all the right answers!

## Installation
Live page: https://morgs999.github.io/Javascript-Quiz/

## Usage

From the front page, click the start button to randomly generate a question and answer block.  As you answer correctly your score will increase; as you answer incorrectly, your timer will decrease.  At the end your score is logged into the high score leaderboard (kept in Local Storage).

This is an unfinished application.  Currently the score system is not implemented, so you will only be able to race the clock for now.
